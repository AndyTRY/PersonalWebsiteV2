## grep "Needs Improvement - <#>" to find locations


1.  Currently, Im manually placing the list of skills here. I'm unable to find a better way to dynamically assign the button background.
    Ideally, this data would be sourced from a db file.

2. Ideally I figure a way to do this in the markup {#each} portion. But Svelte dosen't seem to allow Typescript in markup so its hard type annotations here.
   I also need to change the indexing so that the seperate for each loops must continoue of the previous one
    





Potential Improvments:
1.
Yes, in Svelte, even if you call set() on a store with the same value as it currently holds, it will still trigger an update.
This is because Svelte uses strict equality (===) to check if a value has changed, and if the new value is the same as the old one, 
it still considers it an update.
If you want to avoid triggering an update when the value is the same, you can do a check before calling set()
